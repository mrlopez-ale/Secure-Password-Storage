# Secure_Password_Handling

# Secure Password Storage Demonstration

This project demonstrates the correct, secure way to handle user password storage using Python and the `passlib` library, contrasting it with common insecure methods. Understanding and implementing these practices is crucial for protecting user credentials.

## Core Principles of Secure Password Hashing

1.  **Hashing (Not Encryption):**
    * Hashing is a **one-way** cryptographic function. It transforms an input (password) into a fixed-size string of characters (the hash). It's designed to be easy to compute the hash from the password, but computationally infeasible to reverse the process (i.e., get the original password back from the hash).
    * Encryption is **two-way**. Data can be encrypted and then decrypted back to its original form using a key. This is **not** suitable for password storage because if the encryption key is compromised, all stored passwords can be revealed.
    * **We store the *hash* of the password, never the password itself.**

2.  **Salting:**
    * A **salt** is a unique, random piece of data generated for *each* password before it's hashed.
    * **Crucially, every stored password hash must have its own unique salt.**
    * **Why?** Without salts, two users with the same password (e.g., "password123") would have the same hash. Attackers exploit this using "Rainbow Tables" – massive precomputed databases mapping common passwords to their hashes. By adding a unique salt *before* hashing (`hash(password + salt)`), even identical passwords result in different final hashes, rendering rainbow tables useless.
    * The salt is not secret; it's typically stored alongside the hash (often embedded within the hash string itself, as `passlib` does). Its purpose is uniqueness, not secrecy.

3.  **Strong Hashing Algorithm:**
    * Use algorithms specifically designed for password hashing, which are deliberately **slow** and computationally expensive. This makes brute-force attacks (where attackers try millions of password combinations) much harder and more time-consuming.
    * Good choices include **bcrypt**, **Argon2** (often considered the current best practice), or **scrypt**.
    * Avoid fast hashing algorithms like **MD5**, **SHA-1**, or **SHA-256** (when used alone without proper salting and key stretching/cost factors). They were designed for speed (e.g., file integrity checks) and can be cracked too quickly with modern hardware.

4.  **Cost Factor (Work Factor / Rounds):**
    * Modern password hashing algorithms like bcrypt have a configurable "cost factor" (sometimes called work factor or rounds). For bcrypt, this is typically a power of 2 (e.g., a cost factor of 12 means $2^{12}$ rounds of computation).
    * This parameter directly controls how slow/expensive the hashing process is.
    * **Higher cost = More secure against brute-force = Slower hashing/verification.**
    * A balance must be struck between security and user experience (login time). `passlib` uses sensible defaults (currently 12 for bcrypt), which can be adjusted based on your hardware and security requirements.

## Design Rationale: Why Hashing is Used for Password Storage (Not Encryption)

A core security principle underpinning this demonstration is the deliberate choice of **hashing** over **encryption** for managing user passwords. This decision is critical for secure credential management and is based on the following rationale:

**1. The Primary Goal: Verification Without Exposure**

The objective when handling passwords is to verify a user's identity when they log in *without* ever storing their actual password in a recoverable format. We only need to confirm if the password they provide matches the one they originally set.

**2. Hashing Enables Secure Verification**

* **One-Way Process:** Cryptographic hash functions (like bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt used via `passlib`) are designed to be **one-way**. They transform an input password into a fixed-size string (the hash) in such a way that it's computationally infeasible to reverse the process and derive the original password from the hash.
* **How Verification Works:**
    * **(Registration):** The user's chosen password is passed through the hash function. The resulting hash (which includes a unique salt) is stored in the database – *not* the password itself.
    * **(Login):** The password entered by the user during login is passed through the *exact same* hash function, using the salt retrieved from the stored hash record.
    * **(Comparison):** The newly generated hash is compared to the hash stored in the database. If they are identical, the password is correct.
* **Security Benefit:** This process verifies the user's password without the system ever needing to store or access the plaintext version after registration. If the database containing the hashes is compromised, the passwords themselves are not immediately revealed.

**3. Encryption's Unsuitability and Risks**

* **Two-Way Process:** Encryption is inherently **two-way**. Data encrypted with a key can be decrypted back to its original form using the appropriate key.
* **The Key Management Problem:** If passwords were encrypted, the application would need access to the decryption key to verify login attempts (either by decrypting the stored password or encrypting the attempt). This decryption key becomes a critical point of failure. If an attacker compromises the system and obtains both the encrypted passwords and the decryption key, they can recover *all* the original passwords, nullifying the protection. Securely managing such a key while ensuring application availability is notoriously difficult.

**Conclusion (Rationale)**

Hashing is the appropriate cryptographic tool for password storage because its one-way nature perfectly aligns with the goal of verification without storing the secret. It avoids the significant security risks associated with the key management required by encryption. This project utilizes strong, salted hashing (bcrypt) as the standard, secure method.

## Implementation using Python `passlib`

We use the `passlib` library, which provides a high-level interface for various password hashing algorithms.

**Setup (`CryptContext`):**

```python
from passlib.context import CryptContext

# Configure context: Use bcrypt, handle future deprecations automatically
pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")
We create a CryptContext specifying bcrypt as the desired scheme.deprecated="auto" allows passlib to potentially upgrade hash parameters (like cost factor) over time if needed, without breaking verification of older hashes.Hashing a Password (Simulating Registration):def hash_password_securely(password: str) -> str:
    """Hashes a password using the configured CryptContext (bcrypt)."""
    # passlib automatically generates a unique salt for each call
    # and includes algo info, cost factor, and salt in the output string.
    return pwd_context.hash(password)

# Example:
password_to_store = "UserP@ssw0rd"
hashed_string = hash_password_securely(password_to_store)
# Example hashed_string: '$2b$12$aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTu.aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuO'
#                          ^  ^  ^------Salt (22 chars)-----^ ^---Hash (31 chars)--^
#                          |  |
#                  Algorithm Cost Factor
#                   (bcrypt)   (12)
# Store this 'hashed_string' in your database user record.
Verifying a Password (Simulating Login):def verify_password_securely(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
    """Verifies a plaintext password against a stored hash string."""
    # passlib automatically extracts the algorithm, cost factor, and salt
    # from the 'hashed_password' string. It then re-hashes the
    # 'plain_password' using those same parameters and compares the result.
    return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)

# Example:
user_entered_password = input("Enter your password: ")
# Retrieve the 'hashed_string' from the database for this user
stored_hash = get_hash_from_db(user_id) # Function to get hash from DB

if verify_password_securely(user_entered_password, stored_hash):
    print("Login Successful!")
else:
    print("Invalid Password.")
