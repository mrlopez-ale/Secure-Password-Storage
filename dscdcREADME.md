(Note: This secti compromise exposing all passwords.
Key Point: We store the hash of the password, never the password itself.
B. Salting: Adding Uniqueness & Defeating Rainbow Tables
Salt: A unique, random piece of data generated for each password before hashing.
Importance: Prevents attackers from using "Rainbow Tables" (precomputed hash lookups). By adding a unique salt (hash(password + salt)), even identical passwords result in different final hashes for different users.
Storage: The salt is not secret and is typically stored alongside the hash (often embedded within the hash string itself, as passlib does).
C. Strong Hashing Algorithm: Choosing the Right Tool
Requirement: Use algorithms specifically designed for password hashing â€“ deliberately slow and computationally expensive to hinder brute-force attacks.
Recommended Choices: bcrypt, Argon2 (often considered the current best practice), scrypt.
Algorithms to Avoid: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 (when used alone without proper salting and key stretching/cost factors). These are too fast and vulnerable.
D. Cost Factor (Work Factor / Rounds): Balancing Security & UX
Cost Factor: A configurable parameter (e.g., in bcrypt) controlling the computational cost (time) of hashing.
Trade-off: Higher cost factor = more security against brute-force, but slower hashing/verification.
Balance: passlib uses sensible defaults. Adjust based on hardware and security needs.
5. Design Rationale: Why Hashing is Used (Not Encryption)
Primary Goal: Verify a user's identity without storing their actual password in a recoverable format.
Hashing Enables Secure Verification:
The one-way nature makes reversing the hash infeasible.
Verification Process: Hash the login attempt's password (using the stored salt) and compare it to the stored hash.
Security Benefit: The system never needs the plaintext password after registration.
Encryption's Unsuitability:
Requires secure key management, which is complex and creates a single point of failure. If the key is compromised, all encrypted passwords can be revealed.
Conclusion: Hashing aligns perfectly with the goal of secure verification without storing the secret, avoiding the risks of encryption key management.
6. Why This Approach (bcrypt via passlib) is Secure:
Unique Salts: passlib automatically generates a unique salt for every hash, defeating rainbow table attacks.
Adaptive & Slow: bcrypt is computationally expensive and has an adjustable cost factor, making brute-force guessing significantly harder and slower compared to fast hashes like MD5.
Standard & Vetted: bcrypt is a widely used and scrutinized industry standard. passlib provides a robust and correct implementation.
Ease of Use: passlib abstracts away the complexities of salt generation, encoding, and verification logic.
7. Comparison with Insecure Methods:
Plaintext:
Risk: Storing passwords as readable text. The most dangerous method.
Impact: If the data store is breached, all user passwords are immediately exposed. Never do this.
Unsalted Fast Hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA1):
Vulnerable to Rainbow Tables: No unique salt means identical passwords always produce the same hash, making them trivial to look up in precomputed tables.
Too Fast: These algorithms execute extremely quickly, allowing attackers to test billions of password guesses per second on modern hardware, making brute-force feasible.
8. Overall Conclusion:
Protecting user passwords is paramount. Always use a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm like bcrypt or Argon2, ensuring each password hash uses a unique salt. passlib in Python provides an excellent and easy way to implement these best practices. Avoid plaintext storage and weak/fast hashing algorithms entirely.
